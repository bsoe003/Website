Sherry is a robot that can be controlled through <a href='https://hangouts.google.com/' target='_blank'>Google Hangout</a>. This project was built during Ooyala Hackathon 2015 with a group of summer interns. The robot itself is built with <a href='https://www.particle.io/' target='_blank'>Particle Core</a> and Google Hangout controller is built with <a href='https://www.meteor.com/' target='_blank'>Meteor.js</a> and <a href='https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/' target='_blank'>Hangout API</a>. Both hardware and software communicates through Wi-Fi while sending packets through UDP.",

    "description": "Many college students depend on using podcast to review lecture materials for their classes. However, determing which part of podcast is useful can be painful. Podcats (with \"cat\", NOT \"cast\") makes this process easier. At first, as the lecture is ongoing, Podcats allows students to \"bookmark\" which parts of the podcast are important or hard to understand. After the lecture, the application archieves the podcast to user's profile in which he/she can find important lecture parts through their bookmark; the bookmark features are inspired by existing applications such as <a href='https://www.pinterest.com/' target='_blank'>Pinterest</a> and <a href='https://soundcloud.com/' target='_blank'>SoundCloud</a>. The application is built mainly with <a href='https://www.mongodb.com/' target='_blank'>MongoDB</a>, <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank'>Node.js</a>, and <a href='https://expressjs.com/' target='_blank'>Express.js</a>.",

    "brief": "Ask for help during hackathons!",
    "description": "In 2014, <a href='http://cses.ucsd.edu/' target='_blank'>Computer Science and Engineering Society</a> (CSES) had a vision to improve hackathon culture at UC San Diego. The first hackathon event hosted by CSES and <a href='http://tesc.ucsd.edu/' target='_blank'>Triton Student Engineering Council</a> (TESC) was a hackathon with two divisions: novice and expert. During this hackathon, there were 2 separate rooms that are located in 2 different floors; this made difficult to get help for students. HackerHelpMe was built to solve this problem. The participants of this hackathon can use this tool to ask their mentors for the assistance. The mentors can also use this tool to see which \"hacker\" has asked for help, where they are located, and what portion they need help on. This is mainly built with <a href='https://firebase.google.com/' target='_blank'>Firebase</a> and <a href='http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/' target='_blank'>FlatUI</a>.",
